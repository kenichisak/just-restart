Hi,

Sorry for contacting you like this but I didn't find any other way.

I'm using your thunderbird add-on "Any confirmation message before send" and I would like to suggest you one modification:
Can you highlight the "Discard" button instead of "OK"? Like this it would even harder to make a mistake.
Is it possible for you?

Thanks for your effort in developiong this useful add-on,

Stefano Perin
